# scikit-shape

Scikit-shape is a Python toolbox for shape detection, image segmentation, and shape analysis. We provide this package as a free, open-source Python module to the research community. Its functionality is well suited to applications in scientific image analysis, medical image processing, and computer vision. Scikit-shape is built on the NumPy and SciPy packages to enable Matlab-like interactivity with advanced scripting capabilities and to interface easily with other image processing and machine learning packages, such as SciPy, scikit-image, scikit-learn. The following are some of the functionality provided with scikit-shape:
* Adaptive deformable curves
* Image-based meshing 
* Image regularization and denoising
* Various image segmentation 
* Elastic shape distances
